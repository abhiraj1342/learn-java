Final Variables-----------------------------
If you don't want others (or yourself) to overwrite existing values, 
use the final keyword (this will declare the variable as "final" or "constant", which means unchangeable and read-only):

final int myNum = 15;
myNum = 20;  // will generate an error: cannot assign a value to a final variable

Java vs Python: Variable Assignment Behavior

Java (Primitive Types)-------

int x, y, z;
x = y = z = 50;
Each of x, y, and z is a separate memory location.

They all store the value 50 independently.

Changing one does not affect the others.

✅ Java copies the value — no shared reference for primitives.

Python----------------------

x = y = z = 50
Python variables are references to objects, even for numbers.

50 is an immutable object in memory.

All variables x, y, and z point to the same object (50) initially.
